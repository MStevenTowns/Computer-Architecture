;Attacking Carpetbombing, DoNothing, and Relocate
;But I win more often than I loose against all 6 programs

;This code will drop 1s in 'random' places on the board, every 11 spaces.
;My initial idea was to move the entire program through memory, but it took too many instructions and rarely won
;so instead i took the "carpet bomb" from the examples in CodeBlue Wars.docx and increased the distance
;I tested a bunch of values before settling on 11
;The numbers i tried were:
;1-17
;primes through 30
;highest LCM with 1000(grid size)
;990-1000
; 11 was one of the numbers that produced the best results
;12,13,15,29 produced simmilar results
;To choose the best results i ran the 100 battles about 10 times and then wrote down the wins-losses of a typical set
;any that do not add up to 100 had ties for the difference
;These are not exact numbers, but a rough estimate of how my program should do against each of the test programs

;wins-loss
;Carpet: 68-32
;DoNothing: 57-43
;Relocate: 83-17
;Runner: 7-0
;SimpleLoop: 13-0
;SpotBomb: 51-48

;I am sure there is some mathematical way to choose a number, but I wasn't able to determine that for this project
; Carpet and Relocate were easy to defeat using many numbers, but DoNothing was actually a challenge
;I had to ensure that my program didn't end up killing iself too soon into the challenge.
;Runner and SimpleLoop were easy to beat, but often tied
;SpotBomb uses the same method so it is dificult to beat soundly, and runing the battle 100 times gave an exact result of:
;MyCode: 5111, SpotBomb: 4822, Ties: 67
;This means that I win slightly more often than I loose (51 vs 48)
